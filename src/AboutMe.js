      I am Mehedi. I was born in Bangladesh. I am a mern stack web developer. I
      developed several web applications for a project management software
      client. I was involved in the design and development process for all
      applications and I managed enhancement requests after each rollout. I have
      also been extensively involved in many developer communities.
      <br />
      <br />I have strong analytical and problem skills (mention any other
      skills related to the position) and have no problem working under tight
      deadlines as and when required of me. I am a proven team player, which is
      another important requirement for this position. I was recently voted by
      my peers to receive Cloud Clearwater's Distinguished Developer Award for
      exhibiting ideal teamwork traits, including reliability, good
      communication, commitment, adaptability, and going above and beyond what
      is asked.
